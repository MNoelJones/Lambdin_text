Lesson 11

11.1 The forms of the Infinitive.

The nominal or pronominal object of  many transitive verbs may be suffixed directly to the infinitive without the use of a prepositional object marker, as in

ⲁⲓϭⲓⲛⲉ ⲛ̄ ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ.	->	ⲁⲓϭⲛ̄-ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ.	I found my father.
ⲁⲓϭⲓⲛⲉ ⲙ̄ⲙⲟϥ.		->	ⲁⲓϭⲛ̄ⲧϥ̄.		I found him.

Infinitives that allow this construction have three distinct forms: (1) the normal (absolute) dictionary form (ϭⲓⲛⲉ), (2) the prenominal form (ϭⲛ̄-; note the conventional use of the single hyphen), and (3) the prepronominal form (ϭⲛ̄ⲧ⸗). For infinitives of some patterns these three forms are more or less predictable; for others there is much irregularity. We shall deal with the most important patterns individually in subsequent lessons. The forms of the pronouns to be suffixed to a given infinitive are very much the same as those suffixed to the prepronominal forms of the prepositions as given in SS9.1. Other examples will be given as required.

11.2 Infinitives of the pattern ϫⲓ (i.e. consonant + ⲓ).

Infinitives of this pattern show some irregularities, but three of these verbs (ϥⲓ, ϯ, ϫⲓ) are especially frequent and their forms should be learned:

ϯ		ϯ-		ⲧⲁⲁ⸗		to give
ϫⲓ		ϫⲓ-		ϫⲓⲧ⸗		to take
ϥⲓ		ϥⲓ-		ϥⲓⲧ⸗		to raise, carry
ϣⲓ		ϣⲓ-		ϣⲓⲧ⸗		to measure.

The verbs ⲥⲓ (to become seated) and ⲉⲓ (to come) are intransitive and do not take direct objects. ϥⲓ, ϣⲓ, and ⲥⲓ may also be spelled as ϥⲉⲓ, ϣⲉⲓ, and ⲥⲉⲓ; the spelling ⲧⲉⲓ for ϯ is rare.

Object pronouns are attached to these verbs as follows:

ϫⲓⲧ
ϫⲓⲧⲕ̄
ϫⲓⲧⲉ
ϫⲓⲧϥ̄
ϫⲓⲧⲥ̄

ϫⲓⲧⲛ̄
ϫⲓ-ⲧⲏⲩⲧⲛ̄
ϫⲓⲧⲟⲩ

ⲧⲁⲁⲧ
ⲧⲁⲁⲕ
ⲧⲁⲁⲧⲉ
ⲧⲁⲁϥ
ⲧⲁⲁⲥ
ⲧⲁⲁⲛ
ϯ-ⲧⲉⲩⲧⲛ̄
ⲧⲁⲁⲩ

Note that ⲧⲏⲩⲧⲛ (2nd pers. pl.) is attached to the prenominal form of the infinitive; the prepronominal form is also found: ϫⲓⲧ-ⲧⲏⲩⲧⲛ̄.
