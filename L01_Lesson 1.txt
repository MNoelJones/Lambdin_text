Lesson 1

1.1 Gender

There are two grammatical genders in Coptic: masculine and femenine. Nouns denoting male beings are usually masculine; those denoting females, femenine. The gender of other nouns cannot, in general, be deduced either from their form or meaning and must be learned for each noun. Examples:

Masculine
ⲈⲒⲰⲦ	father
ⲔⲀϨ		earth, ground
ϨⲞⲞⲨ	day

Femenine
ⲘⲀⲀⲨ	mother
ⲠⲈ		sky, heaven
ⲞⲨϢⲎ	night

There are some pairs of nouns where a formal relationship exists between the masculine and the femenine form:

masculine 			feminine
ⲤⲞⲚ		brother		ⲤⲰⲚⲈ	sister
ϢⲎⲢⲈ	boy, son	ϢⲈⲈⲢⲈ	girl, daughter
ϨⲖ̄ⲖⲞ	old man 	ϨⲖ̄ⲖⲰ	old woman
ⲞⲨϨⲞⲢ	dog (male)	ⲞⲨϨⲰⲢⲈ	dog (female)

These will be noted in the lesson vocabularies. The derivational process involved is no longer a productive one in Coptic: such pairs cannot be formed at will.

1.2 Number: singular and plural.

Only a relatively small number of nouns have preserved a distinct plural form. For example:

singular			plural
ⲈⲒⲰⲦ	father		ⲈⲒⲞⲦⲈ	fathers
ⲤⲞⲚ		brother		ⲤⲚⲎⲨ	brothers
ϪⲞⲒ		ship		ⲈϪⲎⲨ	ships

The plural is otherwise made explicit by the form of the article (see below), the noun itself remaining unchanged.

Those plurals that are in common use will be given in the lesson vocabularies along with the singular. They should be learned as they occur, since there is no consistent pattern for their formation.

1.3 The definite article.

The definite article has the forms

masc. sing.		Ⲛ, ⲚⲈ
fem. sing.		Ⲧ, ⲦⲈ
common plural 	Ⲛ̄, ⲚⲈ

These are attached directly to the noun, as in

ⲢⲰⲘⲈ	man 	ⲠⲢⲰⲘⲈ	the man 	Ⲛ̄ⲢⲰⲘⲈ	the men
ϬⲒϪ		hand	ⲦϬⲒϪ		the hand	Ⲛ̄ϬⲒϪ	the hands

The plural article appears as Ⲙ̄ before Ⲡ and Ⲙ (cf. Intro, p.xvi):

ⲠⲈ 		sky		ⲦⲠⲈ		the sky		Ⲙ̄ⲠⲎⲨⲈ	the heavens
ⲘⲀⲈⲒⲚ	sign 	ⲠⲘⲀⲈⲒⲚ	the sign 	Ⲙ̄ⲘⲀⲈⲒⲚ	the signs

Before nouns beginning with a vowel the plural article appears as either Ⲛ̄ or Ⲛ:

ⲈϪⲎⲨ	ships	Ⲛ̄ⲈϪⲎⲨ or ⲚⲈϪⲎⲨ		the ships

Before initial stroked consonants there are several possibilities:

Ⲛ̄ⲦⲞⲚ, ⲈⲘⲦⲞⲚ 	repose	ⲠⲈⲘⲦⲞⲚ, ⲠⲘ̄ⲦⲞⲚ, ⲠⲈⲘⲦⲞⲚ	the repose
Ⲛ̄ⲔⲀ, ⲈⲚⲔⲀ		thing	ⲚⲈⲚⲔⲀ, ⲚⲚ̄ⲔⲀ, Ⲛ̄Ⲛ̄ⲔⲀ		the things

The fuller forms of ⲠⲈ-, ⲦⲈ-, ⲚⲈ- are used regularly before nouns beginning with two consonants:

ⲔⲖⲞⲘ	crown	ⲠⲈⲔⲖⲞⲘ		the crown	ⲚⲈⲔⲖⲞⲘ	the crowns
ⲤϨⲒⲘⲈ	woman	ⲦⲈⲤϨⲒⲘⲈ		the woman	ⲚⲈϨⲒⲞⲘⲈ	the women

Note that ⲞⲨ and (Ⲉ)Ⲓ have a consonantal value (*w* and *y* respectively) in certain initial situations:

ⲞⲨϨⲞⲢ 	dog 	ⲠⲈⲨϨⲞⲢ the dog (*pewhor*)	ⲚⲈⲨϨⲞⲞⲢ	the dogs
ϨⲒⲎ		road	ⲦⲈϨⲒⲎ	the road (*tehyē*)	ⲚⲈϨⲒⲞⲞⲨⲈ	the roads

The fuller forms are also used with certain nouns denoting periods of time:

ⲠⲈⲞⲨⲞⲈⲒϢ	the time
ⲠⲈϨⲞⲞⲨ		the day
ⲦⲈⲨⲚⲞⲨ		the hour  (ⲞⲨⲚⲞⲨ)
ⲦⲈⲢⲞⲘⲠⲈ	the year
ⲦⲈⲨϢⲎ		the night (ⲞⲨϢⲎ)

Note that ⲞⲨⲚⲞⲨ and ⲞⲨϢⲎ fall under the two-consonant rule above.

1.4 Prepositions

Coptic prepositions are proclitic (i.e. unstressed and bound) to the word they govern. In many texts some or all of the prepositions are printed as a unit with the following word: ϨⲒⲠϪⲞⲒ on the ship, ⲈⲠⲎⲒ to the house. In this text, however, all prepositions will be printed as separate words: ϨⲒ ⲠϪⲞⲒ, Ⲉ ⲠⲎⲒ. An exception will be made only in the case of the preposition Ⲉ (to, for) if it is ligatured orthographically to a following ⲞⲨ- as ⲈⲨ-.

The preposition ⲘⲚ̄ (with) is used as a conjunction "and" in joining two nouns: ⲠⲢⲰⲘⲈ ⲘⲚ̄ ⲦⲈⲤϨⲒⲘⲈ the man and the woman.

A definite noun followed by a prepositional phrase or local adverb (e.g. Ⲙ̄ⲘⲀⲨ there) constitutes a full predication (sentence) in Coptic:

ⲠⲢⲰⲘⲈ ϨⲒ ⲠϪⲞⲒ.		The man is on the ship.
ⲦⲈⲤϨⲒⲘⲈ ϨⲘ̄ ⲠⲎⲒ.		The woman is in the house.
ⲚⲈϪⲎⲨ Ⲙ̄ⲘⲀⲨ.		The ships are there.

In sentences of this type there is no overt equivalent of English "is/are." We shall refer to sentences of this type as sentences with adverbial predicates.

Vocabulary 1

In lesson vocabularies all nouns will be given with the definite article, separated from the noun by a period. This device makes both the gender of the noun and the correct form of the article clear at a glance. To save space, the article is not included in the definition.

Prepositions and particles which regularly have assimilation of the final Ⲛ̄ to Ⲙ̄ before Ⲡ and Ⲙ will be noted, as  e.g. ϨⲚ̄ (ϨⲘ̄).

Ⲡ.ⲢⲰⲘⲈ 				man, person, mankind.
ⲦⲈ.ⲤϨⲒⲘⲈ (pl. ⲚⲈϨⲒⲞⲘⲈ)	woman, wife.
Ⲡ.ϨⲖ̄ⲖⲞ 				old man
ⲐⲖ̄ⲖⲰ (Ⲧ.ϨⲖ̄ⲖⲰ)		old woman
Ⲡ.ϪⲰⲰⲘⲈ				book, book-roll, document.
Ⲡ.ⲰⲚⲈ					stone.
ⲦⲈ.ϨⲒⲎ (pl. ⲚⲈ.ϨⲒⲞⲞⲨⲈ)	road, way, path.
Ⲡ.ⲦⲞⲞⲨ					mountain; monastery.
Ⲡ.ⲎⲒ					house.
Ⲡ.ⲚⲞⲨⲂ					gold.
ϨⲚ̄ (ϨⲘ̄)				in.
ϨⲀ						under.
ϨⲒ 						on, upon.
ϨⲒϪⲚ̄ (ϨⲒϪⲘ̄)			on, upon.
ⲘⲚ̄ 					with, together with, in the company of; and.
